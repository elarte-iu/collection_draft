No one has done so much and so well in so short a time.’ Because, like the emperor, he had accomplished a great deal in only a few years, he became known as the ‘Napoleon of medicine.’ The emperor ordered that a bust of Bichat be placed in the Hôtel-Dieu.  

“Working essentially without benefit of a microscope (then still unperfected), Bichat identified some twenty-one different types of tissues and showed that tissues from different organs are similar and subject to the same diseases. Modern histology may be said to have been founded by this young physician. He made animal experiments as well as clinical observations in his search for the ‘vital properties of each tissue’ but defined his thoughts in the negative statement, ‘Life is the sum of the forces that resist death.’  

“Bichat laid the foundation for a biologic attitude to medical problems and influenced such successors as Laënnec and Bernard in France, Bell and Brodie in England, and Virchow and von Kölliker in Germany” (Waife et al. 157).",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Bichat, Marie-Francois-Xavier, [*Traité d'anatomie descriptive*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15711259)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15711250,QM23 .B6 v. 1 - v. 4,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Before his death at the age of sixty-eight, he had transformed La Salpêtrière from a women’s prison—an asylum for the aged, infirm, and insane—into the greatest neurologic clinic of modern times. 

“Although he is remembered primarily for his contributions to neurology, Charcot’s first areas of interest were rheumatism, gout, and the diseases of the elderly. At the age of twenty-eight, he completed his doctoral thesis on the differential symptoms and lesions of gout and arthritis. His first professional post at La Salpêtrière was in pathologic anatomy; in 1882, when the department of neurology was created, he became its first professor and chairman and remained in that position until his death eleven years later. 

“In 1876, Charcot published his work on the localization of functions in cerebral and spinal disease. The book is clinically oriented and deals with such topics as hemiplegia and spinal lesions. Cerebral disorders are discussed in the first part and spinal disorders in the second. Small black-and-white illustrations clarify the text. 

“Charcot’s far-reaching interests and contributions are commemorated in the wide range of clinical entities that bear his name. Among these are the Charcot triad (intention tremor, nystagmus, and staccato speech) that occurs in multiple sclerosis; Charcot’s joint, a neuropathic arthropathy seen in diabetic polyneuritis, syringomyelia, and tabes dorsalis, in which articular cartilage and subjacent bone degenerate and result in joint instability; and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or peroneal muscular atrophy. 

“Charcot brought order into the classification of nervous diseases and was a pioneer in psychotherapy. Freud worked with him for a few months in 1885 and later translated Charcot’s lectures into German. Charcot defined hysteria as ‘a condition induced by purely mental processes;’ it depended, he said, on the subject’s susceptibility to suggestion and did not arise from organic lesions in the central nervous system. 

“Not only was Charcot a superb teacher who could mimic tics, spasms, rigidity, and other symptoms for his students, but his skill as a clinician was recognized internationally. He described multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tabetic arthropathies, and spastic paralysis. Other areas of interest included exophthalmic goiter and intermittent claudication” (Waife et al. 229).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Charcot, Jean Martin, [*Les centres moteurs corticaux chez l'homme*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15713652) ; [*Iconographie photographique de la Salpêtrière : service de M.

Although the latter were intended as mere ornamental supplements, they constitute the first accurate delineations of some of the species shown. The book was clearly inspired by Vesalius’s *Fabrica*, but Cheselden pointed out that Vesalius’s illustrations were sometimes imprecise in detail. Cheselden used the camera obscura to assist van der Gucht with the drawings. 

“Cheselden’s first book, on anatomy, was published in 1713 when he was only twenty-five, but it held against rival texts until the end of the century. In fact, the thirteenth edition was published in 1792. The book was intended for surgical students and was concerned almost entirely with the anatomy of the superficial parts and the extremities. The viscera, then not very accessible to the surgeon, are described rather summarily. 

“His second book, published in 1723, concerned the newly introduced ‘high,’ or suprapubic, operation for stone in the bladder. Because this involved Cheselden in a priority dispute with the brothers James and John Douglas, in which he was wildly abused and accused of plagiarism, he evolved the lateral operation. In 1728, he restored the sight of a blind boy by iridotomy with a needle to form an artificial pupil. This remarkable achievement, in addition to its surgical merit, provoked much discussion of the philosophic and psychologic implications of visual perception. 

“In addition to his surgical skills, Cheselden was a patron of boxing, an architect, and a draftsman. In the days before anesthesia, when speed of operation was a necessary attribute for all surgeons, he was notable among his peers for being able to perform a lithotomy within fifty-four seconds. His standing in eighteenth-century England can be inferred from Pope’s lines: 

        “‘I’ll do what Mead and Cheselden advise,  
           To keep these limbs and to preserve those   
              eyes’” (Waife et al. 107).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Cheselden, William, [*The anatomy of the humane body : illustrated with twenty-three copper-plates of the most considerable parts, all done after the life*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15711088)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15735982,QM101 .C524,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Dioscorides described more than six hundred plants and plant principles encountered during his army service in the lands around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. The compendium, written in Greek, noted the plants’ botanic characteristics and their real or traditional medical properties. Almost one hundred of these plants still serve a pharmaceutical purpose today.  

“Although opium had been in use for centuries, Dioscorides was the first to write about its virtues, to point out its great benefits in the relief of pain, insomnia, and chronic cough, and to note its dangerous effects, particularly those of overdose. He was also the first to describe the medicinal usefulness of aloes, ammoniac, aconite, and ginger. He invented the name ‘*hydrargyrum*’ (liquid silver) for mercury; he recommended iron for uterine hemorrhage and aspidium for tapeworm infestation; and he was the first to state the need for testing the purity of drugs. Among the methods he advised for detecting adulteration were drug solubility, specific gravity, and reaction to ignition.  

“Dioscorides also dealt with animal and mineral products useful in medicine and discussed diet and wines. He suggested mandragora wine for insomnia and pain and specifically for analgesia during surgery. An astute observer, Dioscorides recognized family relationships between plants seventeen centuries before Linnaeus.  

“By the sixth century, the poorly organized compendium had been rearranged alphabetically, illustrations of plants had been added, and a Latin translation had been made. The book was translated during the following centuries into most of the languages of the modern and ancient world, including Arabic in the ninth century. The first printed edition, a Latin version, appeared in Italy in 1478, and the original Greek text was published in Venice in 1499. The revival of the teachings of Dioscorides during the Renaissance laid the foundations for scientific botany and pharmacy. Unfortunately, because all plants were thought to be universally distributed, a great deal of time and ingenuity were wasted in trying to equate western flora with the plants described by Dioscorides” (Waife et al. 21).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Dioscorides, [*Pedakiou Dioskoridou tou Anazarbeōs ta Sōzomena hapanta . . .*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/1414291) ; Mattioli, Pietro Andrea, [*Les commentaires de M.P.

In the preface of his monumental work, he stated that he had begun forty years previously to make “personal observations from Florida to Canada of the causes, symptoms, pathology, and treatment’ of the diseases prevailing in the midlands of the continent, into which men of European origin and their African slaves were rapidly spreading. This is an epic record of the physical state of the nation during the decades of the westward movement and offers a physician’s view of health and sickness among the peoples of a vast and diversified region.  

“Drake (1785-1852) died after only half his papers had been published; the second book was edited and issued posthumously in 1854. The first volume surveyed the “topographical and hydrographical etiology” of disease in twelve areas that extended north and east from the Delta of the Mississippi through the Ohio and St. Lawrence basins and from the Great Lakes to the Arctic.

The first volume surveyed the “topographical and hydrographical etiology” of disease in twelve areas that extended north and east from the Delta of the Mississippi through the Ohio and St. Lawrence basins and from the Great Lakes to the Arctic. He discussed the climate (including the prevalent winds and storms) and its effects on health, dealing particularly with the central areas around St. Louis and Cincinnati. He also described ‘physiological and social etiology,’ population, and the modes of living of the inhabitants, such as their occupations and recreations. This book included the first part of Drake’s strictly medical reports, with chapters on ‘autumnal fever.’ The twenty-seven chapters of the posthumous volume contained the remainder of these medical reports, classified under five different types of fever.  

“Drake was a picturesque character. Restless, critical, and combative by nature, he was a crusader for improved medical education in the frontier lands. He filled successively seven teaching positions in the Midwest and founded two medical faculties—the Medical College of Ohio (1821) and the medical department of Cincinnati College (1835). He established a western medical journal, and in it appeared his celebrated series of essays on medical education, eminently readable even today. In these, he strongly criticized the way physicians were being prepared for their profession.

While examining sputum samples for the bacilli that cause tuberculosis, he accidentally discovered that the organisms would stain readily if the slides were exposed to heat during the staining procedure. Characteristically modest, he gave credit for the finding to the cleaning woman who, when tidying the laboratory, had inadvertently placed his slides on a hot stove. Ehrlich developed the differential white-blood-cell count as a tool for the diagnosis of leukemia and was the first to recognize aplastic anemia and to describe the red-blood-cell inclusion bodies seen in toxic hemolytic disorders.

Ehrlich’s side-chain theory, in which he postulated the production of immunologically specific antibodies against invading microorganisms, ultimately won him universal recognition.

Falloppio then died of tuberculosis before receiving Vesalius’ answer, and Vesalius died on the Greek island of Zante in the Ionian Sea in 1564 on his way home from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The text of his answer to Falloppio was published by friends later that year.  

“Falloppio’s most original contribution was made in his dissections and discussions of the female reproductive organs. He first clearly differentiated and named several special structures and, in particular, described the oviducts named for him. He himself employed the Latin term *tuba*, a trumpet, to indicate their trumpet-shaped lateral extremities.  

“Falloppio added to knowledge of the centers of ossification and described the primary teeth and their replacement. He improved on earlier accounts of the muscles of the head and face and also made numerous discoveries concerning nerve pathways. He was the first anatomist to delineate precisely all three ossicles of the ear, and he provided a full description of the kidney” (Waife et al. 39).",Lilly Library,stillimage,"Vesalius, Andreas et al., [*Opera omnia anatomica et chirurgica*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15712493)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15713621,QM421 .F2,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

However, his labors as “perpetual curate” at St. Mary’s-in-the- Meadows were overshadowed by his achievements in physiology and botany.  

“Hales began his study of the circulation by measuring the blood pressure of experimental animals, such as horses and sheep; his manometer was a long glass tube, connected to the animal's carotid artery by means of the windpipe of a goose. The blood pressure was measured directly from the height of the blood in the glass column.

In 1851, he invented his “eye-mirror,” or ophthalmoscope, a tool of immense importance for the diagnosis of pathologic conditions in the eye, and introduced the device in this forty-nine-page booklet.  

“In his monograph, von Helmholtz comments, ‘We need a source of light to observe sufficiently the part of the retina at which we look through the pupil, and we can see the background of the eye only through a refractive medium.’ The mechanism of the instrument is described and clarified by means of a diagram.  

“Von Helmholtz was thirty when he invented the ophthalmoscope. Four years earlier, he had presented his theoretical conclusions on the conservation of energy to the Physical Society of Berlin, and publication of his essay established the first law of thermodynamics. In 1852, using a pendulum-myograph he had invented, he measured the velocity of the nervous impulse; the mean of his observations was about thirty meters per second, a value accepted today.  

“Von Helmholtz had been educated in Berlin as a surgeon for the Prussian army. He was of German, French, and English extraction; his mother was a direct descendant of William Penn. It was in the barracks laboratory at Potsdam, the city of his birth, that he conducted his research on the conservation of energy. At the age of twenty-nine, he was appointed professor of physiology and pathology at the University of Konigsberg.

In 1851, he invented his “eye-mirror,” or ophthalmoscope, a tool of immense importance for the diagnosis of pathologic conditions in the eye, and introduced the device in this forty-nine-page booklet.  

“In his monograph, von Helmholtz comments, ‘We need a source of light to observe sufficiently the part of the retina at which we look through the pupil, and we can see the background of the eye only through a refractive medium.’ The mechanism of the instrument is described and clarified by means of a diagram.  

“Von Helmholtz was thirty when he invented the ophthalmoscope. Four years earlier, he had presented his theoretical conclusions on the conservation of energy to the Physical Society of Berlin, and publication of his essay established the first law of thermodynamics. In 1852, using a pendulum-myograph he had invented, he measured the velocity of the nervous impulse; the mean of his observations was about thirty meters per second, a value accepted today.  

“Von Helmholtz had been educated in Berlin as a surgeon for the Prussian army. He was of German, French, and English extraction; his mother was a direct descendant of William Penn. It was in the barracks laboratory at Potsdam, the city of his birth, that he conducted his research on the conservation of energy. At the age of twenty-nine, he was appointed professor of physiology and pathology at the University of Konigsberg. Later, he occupied the chairs of anatomy and physiology at Bonn and then the chair of physiology at Heidelberg. Finally, when he was fifty, he became professor of physics at Berlin, where he remained until his death. In his laboratory, Heinrich Hertz discovered the electro-physical principles that led to the development of wireless telegraphy, and Henry Augustus Rowland did the basic work on colloid chemistry.

Hunter was an inspired teacher; his school of anatomy attracted men who became famous anatomists and surgeons. Among the latter was his brother John, who was ten years his junior. William Hunter’s home housed not only the school of anatomy but also a museum for his collections—books and manuscripts, paintings, coins, medals, and anatomic and pathologic specimens. These collections were later bequeathed to the University of Glasgow, where Hunter had studied for five years.  

“Hunter spent almost twenty-five years preparing *The Anatomy of the Gravid Human Uterus*, the most magnificent obstetric atlas ever published. He engaged the best artists to draw and engrave the thirty-four illustrations, and it was printed by John Baskerville, the finest printer of the age, at the peak of his career. The life-size line engravings, many measuring 54 by 56 centimeters, achieve effects of depth and contrast without losing sharpness of detail and present a wide range of normal and pathologic conditions of the womb and fetus. Each page of text is printed in two columns, one in Latin and the other in English.  

“William and his brother John explored the anatomy of the placenta and described the separate circulatory systems of the mother and the fetus. The brothers later quarreled over who should receive recognition for this work and separated professionally about three years before William’s death.   

“William Hunter was the first to describe retroversion of the uterus (1770). Outside the field of obstetrics, he is remembered for the first description of arteriovenous aneurysm and for clarifying the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatics. He was professor of anatomy in the Royal Academy and a Fellow of the Royal and Antiquarian societies.  

“Hunter never married. A hardworking, disciplined man who lived simply and frugally, he was troubled by severe attacks of gout, a disease that also affected other members of his family. He died in 1783 at the age of sixty-four” (Waife et al. 133).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Hunter, William, [*The correspondence of Dr. William Hunter, 1740-1783*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7581765)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/6675684,RG520 .H9,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

For many years, Jenner had been a country practitioner and was respected by his local colleagues for his interest in heart disease and his skill in treating it. However, he was more widely known as a naturalist and was a Fellow of the Royal Society. Because he practiced for half the year at the fashionable spa of Cheltenham, influential London physicians referred their important patients to him there.  

“It had long been claimed by farmers and dairymaids that a person who had an attack of cowpox would be immune against smallpox. Jenner was perhaps the first to give this matter serious study. He contended that inoculation with cowpox matter was a practical method of prophylaxis, simpler and safer than inoculation with the attenuated smallpox pus introduced in England in the 1720’s.  

“In his book Jenner advanced three points. First, he maintained that the protective ‘virus,’ which was found in horses, became safe for human inoculation only after it had been transmitted to cows. This confused theory he quietly dropped after longer experience. The next point was that only the ‘true virus’ gave protection and that ‘matter from other pustulous sores’ was ineffective. Lastly, he stated that vaccination gave permanent protection. He modified this opinion later and recommended revaccination in times of smallpox epidemics.  

“Jenner supported these three contentions with twenty-three case histories in his book. The critical ones were those of Sarah Nelmes, the milkmaid from whose hand Jenner first took the cowpox virus, and a boy named James Phipps. In May, 1796, Jenner inoculated the eight-year-old James with “vaccinia,” or cowpox material, and then with virulent smallpox pus to which, as Jenner anticipated, James did not react.

Probably the first to employ the microscope in the investigation of disease was the Jesuit priest of Fulda, Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), contemporary with but slightly older than van Leeuwenhoek. This learned man was a virtuoso musician, orientalist, mathematician, and physicist and had some knowledge of medicine. His study of plague is valuable for its well-understood and carefully explained theory of *contagium vivum* or the infection by living matter. In his *Scrutinium*, published in Rome in 1658, he describes his studies on putrefaction, during which he saw maggots and other creatures develop in necrotic tissue. He found the blood of plague patients full of ‘little worms which propagate plague, so very small and unperceivable except with a very fine microscope.’  

“This description occurs in the central section of his book, where he dealt with the ‘contagion or kindling of plague’ at some length. The earlier chapters discussed the causes and effects of plague, its prognosis, and the signs of its course, with some experiments on infected air. After the chapter on contagion, there is a thorough account of ‘therapeutics and prophylaxis, or the cure and preservation from contagion of the plague.’  

“It seems unlikely that Kircher could have seen bacilli in the blood of plague patients with the simple low-power microscope available at the time. What he actually saw is less important than his realization of the association between disease and bacteria. Though he was probably wrong in identifying the objects under his crude microscope, his concepts led to a correct appreciation of the cause of infectious disease.  

“The last twenty pages of his book provide a chronologic table of historic plague epidemics, including the Great Plague of Athens (430 B.C.) and the Black Death (A.D. 1350)” (Waife et al. 71).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Kircher, Athanasius, [*L'autobiographie d'Athanasius Kircher : l'écriture d'un jésuite entre vérité et invention au seuil de l'oeuvre*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9284483)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/17892625,QR201 .P5 K58,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He devised a microscope with one small, strong objective lens that avoided the distortions and color refraction of previous types of instruments. He made over two hundred microscopes, for which he himself ground most of the lenses, and once sent twenty-six of them as a gift to the Royal Society in London, of which he became a Fellow in 1680. His industry and important observations attracted such wide attention that even Peter the Great, Czar of All the Russias, paid him a visit in 1689 to see his microscopes, and the directors of the East India Company sent him specimens for microscopic examination.  

“Van Leeuwenhoek was the first to see protozoa under the microscope. He found micro-organisms in the mouth and on the teeth and, for the first time, furnished exact descriptions of the shapes of bacterial clumps and chains as well as of individual bacilli.

He had studied first at the University of Bonn, then earned his Ph.D. at Elangen, and continued his studies under Gay-Lussac in Paris. A pioneer in laboratory teaching and agricultural chemistry, he made his reputation as a pure chemist.  

“In 1825, Germany lagged behind other European countries in the field of chemistry. Von Liebig, by creating the first teaching laboratory, inaugurated Germany’s era of brilliant chemical research. He became interested in the application of chemistry to agriculture and tried to introduce scientifically compounded fertilizers to replace local empirical methods of improving the soil. He was the first to suggest that overuse of the soil depleted its nutrients and that they should be replaced by nonorganic chemicals.  

“His interest later extended to medical needs, and he became the first modern chemist to apply the specialized techniques of organic chemistry to physiology, pathology, and pharmacy. He studied many reactions, including the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats and the degradation of proteins and purines to urea, uric acid, and hippuric acid. Paradoxically, despite von Liebig’s inventive nature, he also was a conservative who could not accept Schwann’s demonstration of living cells in yeast and the biotic cause of putrefaction.  

“Von Liebig wrote ‘Organic Chemistry in Its Application to Physiology and Pathology’ at the age of thirty-nine. The treatise was dedicated to the doyen of contemporary chemists, the Swedish scientist John Jacob Berzelius, although Berzelius had criticized him severely. It contains three main sections; the chemical process of respiration and nutrition; the metamorphosis of forms, which carries as a running title on each page, ‘The Chemical Process of the Change of Forms’; and the phenomena of movement in animal organisms, followed by discourses on the theories of disease and of respiration. The medical value of the book, beyond its somewhat theoretical formulation, consists in the clear explanation of the chemical process in respiration (including the importance of oxygen), the introduction of the concept of metabolism, with a classification of the organic foodstuffs. With these three sections, von Liebig laid the foundation of subsequent biochemical knowledge.  

“Von Liebig’s resistance to the new living-cell theory and his conviction that all biologic processes could be explained as chemical reactions led him into some erroneous deductions, but his factual observations had lasting validity” (Waife et al. 197).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Liebig, Justus von, [*Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its application to physiology and pathology*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/651449)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/17891017,QP521 .L716 O68,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

As a young woman, she had sought the best training for a nursing career then available. She chose the Institute of Protestant Deaconesses at Kaiserswerth, Germany, where she learned both nursing and hospital and training-school administration.  

“The need for radical reform in the care of the sick was made evident to Miss Nightingale (1820-1910) not only through her work in a London hospital but also through service in the barracks hospital in Scutari during the Crimean war.  

“So effectively did she cut through ancient regulations in establishing a clean and efficiently run army hospital that, on her return to England, she was asked to establish a training school for nurses. The school opened at St. Thomas’s Hospital in 1860 with fifteen probationers, who lived at the hospital and were instructed by staff and visiting physicians. Graduates of the school were much sought after; many of them subsequently started nursing schools in England and the United States.  

“*Notes on Nursing* was written with simplicity and direct common sense, enlivened by occasional sharp wit. After an introductory chapter in which she stated that ‘nursing ought to assist the reparative process of disease,’ she discussed the conditions necessary for good nursing: ventilation and warmth; the ‘health of the house,’ or domestic hygiene; management (‘being in charge means that the work you do is not undone when your back is turned’); freedom from noise; selection of food; bed and bedding; personal cleanliness and the cleanliness of rooms and walls; and observation of the sick. In conclusion, she pointed out that her rules for nursing the sick applied even more to the care of children and puerperant women. In an appendix, she added statistics on the number of nurses employed at that time in England.  

“A disciple of the pioneer Belgian statistician, Adolphe Quetelet, Florence Nightingale supported all her writings with statistical evidence; she was the first to display this material in colored diagrams with proportioned areas. Notes on Nursing is one of the seminal books of the modern world. It was published a few weeks after another significant work, Darwin’s *Origin of Species*” (Waife et al. 215).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Nightingale, Florence, [*Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British Army . . .*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/16241833) ; Nightingale, Florence, [*Army sanitary administration and its reform under the late Lord Herbert*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/16241857)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/19522868,RT40.N68 N54 1860,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

A native of Lancaster, England, and a pupil of physiologist John Abernethy in London, he had prepared the five-volume *Physiological Catalogue* of John Hunter’s museum and had edited Hunter’s posthumous papers on comparative anatomy and zoology. He was an associate and son-in-law of Hunter’s secretary, William Clift.  

“The scope of Owen’s writing, based on his own dissections and usually illustrated with his own drawings, has hardly been surpassed. He was forty-one when he completed this study, which was published in two volumes five years apart.  

“The work covered the whole range of the toothed vertebrates, fossil and extant, and discussed in detail the microscopic structure of the teeth and the physiology of dentition. After a long introduction, Owen described the dental system of fishes, reptiles, and mammals. The dentition of extinct large reptiles and mammals as well as that of the marsupials and cetacea was included in his survey. Human dentition was treated in the section on mammals. The illustrations by several artists (including the author) are particularly impressive. They comprise 168 full-page plates, mostly lithographs; a few are colored engravings of microstructure.  

“In a sense, dental anatomy and paleontology met here and were brought into the scientific limelight. Owen later wrote many long monographs and large-scale treatises on paleontology and comparative anatomy. One of these was *On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton* (1848), written when he still held the belief that the identity of class, order, genus, and species could be traced back to the beginning of the universe. In his later years, eh became involved in hot controversy with Huxley over Darwinism but eventually was won over to the theory of the evolutionary development of species.

He went on to describe his method of treatment and appended a brief formulary of the mineral medications employed in his clinic. It was shown that mercury was not a universal specific and that some so-called secondary infections were due to mercury poisoning.

He described the course of the disease in many individual patients whom he attended; he discussed the causes of the disease’s rise and decline; and he recounted the controversies among physicians concerning the correct methods of combating the spread of the epidemic and of treating the sick. Rush (1745-1813) printed the texts of notices issued by the city’s government and the College of Physicians, with letters he and other physicians had written to the papers, and he set forth the psychologic as well as the physical ravages of the disease as he himself experienced them and observed them in his own family. By proclaiming his belief that yellow fever was the result of filth in the city and not an importation, he aroused the anger of many citizens of Philadelphia. Now his book is considered a classic in epidemiology.  

“Another important contribution to medical literature was his *Medical Inquiries and Observations, upon the Diseases of the Mind* (1812), the first American text on psychiatry, which had a profound effect on practitioners for several generations.  

“A religious man strongly committed to a concern for the public welfare, he limited his materia medica to just a few drugs and, in order to strip medicine of some of its mystery, refused to write prescriptions in Latin.  

“Rush poured his tireless energy into countless activities. He was a professor of medicine at the new University of Pennsylvania, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and surgeon general (but later resigned) for one department of the Continental army. Furthermore, he was active in the reform movements to abolish slavery and capital punishment and to establish public schools and free medical dispensaries. He discredited fraudulent cancer cures and, perhaps most significant, insisted that insanity was a disease. He was one of the founders of Dickinson College and of the school now known as Franklin and Marshall College and, for the last fourteen years of his life, was Treasurer of the United States Mint” (Waife et al. 147).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Condie, Thomas, [*History of the pestilence, commonly called yellow fever, which almost desolated Philadelphia . . .*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/1429677) ; Rush, Benjamin, [*Medical inquiries and observations, upon the diseases of the mind*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/19045188)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/19027246,RC211 .P5 R75,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Scarpa received his medical degree at the age of eighteen and, at twenty, was appointed professor of anatomy at Modena. Here he immediately published, with his own superb illustrations, a book on his discovery of the membranous labyrinth in the ear. When he was thirty-one, he moved to the more important chair of anatomy at Pavia, which he held for twenty years. In 1787, in addition, he assumed the chair of surgery and held it until 1812. He was equally distinguished as research worker, surgeon, and teacher; wrote well in Latin and Italian; and drew his own illustrations with skill.  

“Perhaps his greatest achievement was his large atlas of ‘Neurologic Plates,’ illustrating the cardiac, cerebral, glossopharyngeal, and pharyngeal nerves. This was published in Latin in 1794. The text includes a general essay on neurology, with accurate criticism of illustrations published by earlier anatomists, such as Willis, Vieussens, and von Haller. The essay is followed by descriptions of his own plates, providing brief, precise comments on the nerves illustrated, with mention of previous accounts. The seven engravings are so large that some organs are pictured life-size. Engraved by Faustino Anderloni from Scarpo’s drawings, the plates are both accurate and brilliant in light and shade. The book offered the first detailed representation and description of the nerves of the heart.  

“The author is best remembered for Scarpa’s triangle, an area bordered by the inguinal ligament and superficial thigh muscles. It was first delineated in his report on an operation for popliteal aneurysm.  

“Scarpa’s anatomic investigations spanned a period of nearly sixty years and included comparative studies of the auditory and olfactory apparatus and the deep structure of bone. His surgical work covered masterly and influential research on the diseases of the eye, congenital clubfoot, aneurysms, hernia, and arterial disease. On each subject, Scarpa offered new knowledge with practical application for the surgeon and clear, well-defined illustrations.  

“Scarpa became director of the Medical Institute at Pavia and continued his research and writing until a year before his death at eighty-one. His work as surgeon and anatomist was carried on in the best tradition of the Italian school” (Waife et al. 145).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Morgagni, Giambattista, [*De sedibus, et causis morborum per anatomen indagatis libri quinque : Dissectiones, et animadversiones . . .*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7341434) ; Scarpa, Antonio, [*Sull'ernie : memorie anatomico-chirurgiche*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/4570425)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15713656,QM451 .S3,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Instead, Sydenham’s contribution was the reintroduction of the Hippocratic method of careful clinical observation based on wide personal experience. As a recorder of the natural history of disease, he had few equals. For example, even today one can read his description of an acute attack of gout with profit and pleasure.  

“His medical education was interrupted twice by military service under Cromwell. Although his formal edication in medicine was somewhat limited, he was a most successful clinician. Conservative and even distrustful of scientific innovations, Sydenham approached the treatment of disease with empiricism. His personal influence was so strong that most of the leading clinicians of the next generation may be considered directly or indirectly his pupils. His contributions, however, were not truly appreciated until after his death, when he came to be known as the ‘English Hippocrates.’  

“It is interesting that the original *Observations* were written in English and published in 1676. The translation into Latin (the proper language of science at the time) was printed nine years later by John Mapletoft, to whom Sydenham dedicated the book. It includes sections on diseases, especially those seen in London epidemics between 1661 and 1675, and the characteristics and treatment of continuous and intermittent fevers, for which he introduced cinchona bark into general use in England. He discussed ‘pest’ (bubonic plague) and smallpox, recommending a regimen of cooling drinks for the latter, and described cholera, dysentery, bilious colic, epidemic cough, pleurisy, pneumonia and ‘false pneumonia,’ rheumatism, and quinsy.  

“Although Sydenham’s notions of the causes of fevers and epidemics were traditional (he believed in ‘epidemic constitutions’ and the influence of atmospheric ‘miasma’), he did note the rhythmic periodicity of the recurrence of epidemics. He also recognized precise ‘species’ of disease, made a distinction between smallpox and measles, and gave the first diagnostic account of scarlatina. He continued to advocate bloodletting in moderation, but his other treatments were simple and sensible: fresh air in the sickroom, exercise for consumptives, iron tonics for anemia, and liquid opiates (laudanum) for pain.  

""Sydenham gained fame through his ‘Treatise on Gout and Dropsy’ (1683), in which he differentiated gout from rheumatism, but his most enduring work was the *Observationes Medicae*. His classic account of hysteria appears in *Dissertatio Epistolaris* (1682)” (Waife et al. 89).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Sydenham, Thomas, [*Dr. Thomas Sydenham, 1624-1689; his life and original writings*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9284555)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/18049961,R114 .S9 1685,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

In differentiating the glands from the viscera, he also explained their relationship. His name has been particularly associated with the duct of the submaxillary salivary gland, called ‘Wharton’s duct,’ and he accurately expounded the role of saliva in mastication and digestion. Even more valuable were his descriptions of the ‘renal glands’ (adrenals) and the thyroid, to which he gave the first adequate treatment, providing its name, ‘thyroid’ (shield-shaped), in place of the former vague ‘laryngeal gland.’  

“His explanations were sometimes teleologic, as when he stated that the purpose of the thyroid was, among other functions, to fill the neck and make it shapely. Elsewhere he attempted a physiologic judgment, suggesting, for instance, that the adrenals act ‘to restore to the veins some humors imbibed from the spleen which were not profitable to the nerves.’ He gave a good account of the spleen and pancreas and furnished the original description of the mucoid matrix (Wharton’s jelly), which keeps the umbilical cord supple and cushions the fetal vessels.  

“The book is arranged in the traditional order (abdominal, thoracic, and cephalic), to which Wharton added a section on the reproductive glands. He worked closely with his colleagues at St. Thomas’ Hospital and with Francis Glisson (q.v.); like Glisson, he stayed in London through the plague but lost his house in the Great Fire of London in 1666. He was one of the conservative physicians who resented the new Royal Society for trespassing on the preserves of the long-established College of Physicians in biologic research. Nevertheless, he was one of many investigators whose individual contributions greatly advanced anatomic research in seventeenth-century England.

He named eight categories according to the appearance of the skin: popular, squamous, exanthematous, bullous, vesicular, pustular, tubercular, and macular. The nomenclature was compiled from Greek, Latin, and Arabic terms. This classification, presented to the Medical Society of London, won him the Fothergillian gold medal in 1790. It was generally adopted in English-speaking countries and is largely in use at the present time.  

“Willan intended this book to be the first volume in a definitive series on dermatology, but it was the only volume the author managed to complete before his death at the age of fifty-five. The contents, originally published serially, covered only part of the classification proposed in the introduction. His student, Thomas Bateman, continued the description in a work published in 1817, which also contains a series of Willan’s engravings.  

“He made many original observations, describing for the first time or providing the first clear differentiation of such disease entities as impetigo, lupus, psoriasis (sometimes known as Willan’s syndrome), scleroderma, ichthyosis, sycosis, and pemphigus.  

“Willan was an early supporter of Edward Jenner, whose announcement of vaccination was published in the summer of 1798, about the same time as the first part of Willan’s *On Cutaneous Diseases*. Jenner had drawn Willan’s attention to the ‘entanglement’ of cowpox herpes, the effect of one virus on another in the same host. Willan himself published a treatise entitled *On Vaccine Inoculuation* in 1806, which strongly advocated compulsory vaccination.  

“He was an accomplished scholar in Latin and Greek, and perhaps that is why certain relatively unfamiliar terms are still used in dermatology. He was also greatly concerned with the sick and indigent and worked to improve the public health of his time.  

“Although Willan’s purely descriptive pathology was superseded by the more profound ‘morbid anatomy’ introduced in his lifetime by Matthew Baillie (q.v.), his book remains one of the foundation stones of modern dermatologic knowledge” (Waife et al. 161).","Waife, McCain, Weber & Hammond's Notable Medical Books",stillimage,"Willan, Robert, [*On vaccine inoculation*](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9671524)",https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9162319,RL61 .W6,"The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.
